This is all for blender purposes only.
Anything that is used otherwise is prohibited and is not on me!

- the changing of the size, shape, or location of the intake and exhaust ports in an internal-combustion engine, generally to improve performance.

Basically taking the games assets/models and "Porting" them to Blender.
